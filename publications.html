           <i> Andrea F. Casanova, Andres Ort, John W. Smallridge, Katrin H. Preller, Erich Seifritz, Franz X. Vollenweider.</i>
<p>Abstract: Serotonergic psychedelics hold promise as a treatment modality for various psychiatric disorders and are currently applied in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. We investigated the learning effects of the serotonin receptor agonist psilocybin in a probabilistic cue-reward task with emotional cues in the form of neutral or fearful faces, presented either consciously or subconsciously. This study represents the first investigation into reinforcement learning with psilocybin. Across different dosages, psilocybin preserved learning effects and was statistically noninferior compared to placebo, while suggesting a higher exploratory behavior. Notably, the 20Â mg group exhibited significantly better learning rates against the placebo group. Psilocybin induced inferior results with subconscious cues compared to placebo, and better results with conscious neutral cues in some conditions. These findings suggest that modulating serotonin signaling in the brain with psilocybin sufficiently preservers reinforcement learning.</p>

Smallridge, Simone Sarasso, Silvia Casarotto, Robin von Rotz, Andrea Casanova, Erich Seifritz, Katrin H. Preller, Giulio Tononi, Franz X. Vollenweider.</i> 
<p>Abstract: Exploring the neurobiology of the profound changes in consciousness induced by classical psychedelic drugs may require novel neuroimaging methods. Serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin produce states of increased sensory-emotional awareness and arousal, accompanied by increased spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity. By directly stimulating cortical tissue, the altered dynamics and propagation of the evoked EEG activity can reveal drug-induced changes in the overall brain state. We combine Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and EEG to reveal that psilocybin produces a state of increased chaotic brain activity which is not a result of altered complexity in the underlying causal interactions between brain regions. We also map the regional effects of psilocybin on TMS-evoked activity and identify changes in frontal brain structures that may be associated with the phenomenology of psychedelic experiences.</p>
